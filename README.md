# Joint and Arm Design
## Joint Design
Two upper and lower cylinders have been used in the design of this joint. Support is connected to the lower cylinder with a small rod. Additionally, a bearing has been added inside the support. Two supports are attached to the upper side. The upper support has a larger diameter than the lower support. Finally, add a keyhole on each side of the rod, and decrease the rod's diameter in the middle to accommodate the hole for the bearing.

## Arm design

The purpose of this project is to control the motion of the arms. For the system to move, each joint should be assigned to a proprietary arm.
